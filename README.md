# ImAvg
This program is supposed to average together any number of pictures regarless of<br/>
size, pixel density, color density, etc. It currently can add all the pixel data together and account <br/>
for any offset caused by the images not being the same size. Unfortunately, I haven't figured out yet <br/>
how to properly divide by a number N once all the pixel data is added up. Dividing by the number of <br/>
pictures just doesn't work and other ideas I have had break when you try to average black with blue<br/>
or colors similar.<br/>
